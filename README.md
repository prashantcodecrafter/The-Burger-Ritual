## 🎯 Goals of the Project

This website is a frontend-focused project to simulate a food ordering experience. It showcases the ability to:
- Build a complete multi-page UI using semantic HTML
- Use JavaScript to handle cart logic and inter-page communication via `localStorage`
- Work with forms, buttons, and responsive design principles
- Add user interactivity and functionality without frameworks

It’s also built to look **professional, simple**, and **aesthetically appealing** — perfect for practice and portfolio.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Users scroll through the **Menu** and click **“Add to Cart”**.
2. Each item gets saved in localStorage (name, price, image, quantity).
3. On the **Cart Page**, saved items are displayed.
4. Users can update item quantities with ➕ and ➖ buttons.
5. Total price updates in real time.
6. Users fill their details and select a payment method.
7. Ready to place an order (future feature: send order data to backend).
